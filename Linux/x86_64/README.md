#Hallways for Linux (x86_64)
All the versions are packed in zip files.
To play, extract the tarball (version of choice) and launch the program file and enjoy :]

Note: I also included the source code so users can customise the game, thanks for looking at my repository!


Update >> 24-12-2020 : Maybe there will no more Linux support for Hallways.
Update >> 27-12-2020 : Sadly, Hallways 4 for Linux is not available.
Update >> 12-01-2021 : Eventually we have managed to keep support for Linux (x86_64).
Update >> 09-03-2021 : We are working on GUI development of the game for better experience, sorry for the waiting.
